# Stake My Score 
A Solana betting protocol where users stake SOL to predict cricket match outcomes (runs and wickets).  

---

## Overview
A **pool-based betting system** on Solana. Users lock a fixed stake into the **escrow PDA** by placing predictions. An **oracle** account submits the final match result. The program determines **winners** and distributes the pot proportionally.
Winners share the pool, losers get nothing, and a small platform fee is deducted.
If a pool has no winners (correct prediction) all bets are refunded.

Built with [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/).
